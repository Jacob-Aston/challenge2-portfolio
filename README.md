# Portfolio

## Description

- This project was to build a portfolio with a responsive layout and clickable links. 
- This project was created to show what I have learned in HTML and CSS.
- It creates a page where you can visit my previous work as well as read a little bit about me. With contact information aswell.
- I learned how to implement grid and flex to designa a responsive layout. I also learned how to add images and turn them into clickable links.
- I did not commit enough time to this project but, I must move on. What would I have done next? I wouldve made my contact list into clickable links with flex positioning. I wouldve also flexed the nav links in the nav bar. I learned a lot getting hands on with code.

## Usage

You can visit the page here: https://jacob-aston.github.io/challenge2-portfolio/

You can visit the page repository here: https://github.com/Jacob-Aston/challenge2-portfolio.git

At the top of the page there are three links you can click to jump to different sections of the page.

The "My Work" section has a layout that responds to the display size. For now only the Horiseon SEO page is a clickable link.
